# Wall ¬∑ E V2

This is my personal project, Wall-E, a robot I designed and built from scratch.

It includes electronics, 3D printed parts, servo motors, sound, a laser, and a taser system (for fun). I made everything myself.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Platforms Used

Here‚Äôs a list of the main tools and platforms I used throughout the WALL¬∑E project:

- **Fusion 360** ‚Äì Designed 3D parts of the robot and exported STL files for 3D printing.
- **Fritzing** ‚Äì Simulated circuits and verified wiring before building the physical prototype.
- **EasyEDA** ‚Äì Created professional circuit schematics and organized the wiring logic.
- **Arduino IDE** ‚Äì Developed and uploaded firmware to the ESP32 microcontroller.
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Used for version control, documentation, and collaboration.
